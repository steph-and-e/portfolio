<!-- 
Create a page with a script that defines a lottery ball object.
A lottery ball has a field defining its color (randomly set to “red” or “white”)
and the number of points it’s worth (random number between 0 and 100).
When the ball is created, use an alert box to tell the user the color
and value of the ball object that was created.
It should be different each time you load the page.
-->
<!--
Modify the script from the last question so that
it creates an array of 100 ball objects with random contents.
Talk to the user with dialog boxes and allow them to draw balls
by entering integers from 0 to 99 (corresponding to an array index),
until either they draw a red ball or decide to quit.
Show them each ball in an alert box.
If they draw a red ball, deduct the number of points that ball is worthfrom their score and end the game.
If they draw a white ball, add the number of points to their score and allow them to continue.
If they try to draw a ball they drew already, or an invalid ball (less than 0, larger than 99)
let them try again. When they quit or draw a red ball, show them their total score in an alert box.
