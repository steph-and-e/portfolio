<!--
1. Write a script on a web page that presents the user with an arithmetic problem (for example what is 23 + -4?) and asks for the answer using a prompt. Then give them feedback using an alert box.
2. Extend the script so that it generates the integers for the arithmetic problem randomly using Math.floor(Math.random() * 201) – 100. Keep presenting the question until they get it right. Then give them a success message in an alert box. For an explanation of random number generation see JS Random on W3Schools.
3. Extend the script so that it asks the user if they would like another question using a confirm dialog and gives them another question if they press “OK”. If they press “Cancel”, the page should finish loading and display a goodbye message.
